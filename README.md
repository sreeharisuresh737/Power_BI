# Power_BI
In this repository I have done a power BI project on real time twitter data set.

#Tasks

1. Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (top 10%). Include only those tweets that have received more than 50 likes and were posted on weekdays and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself as well as tweet character count should be below 30.

2. Plot a scatter chart to analyse the relationship between media engagements and media views for tweets that received more than 10 replies. Highlight tweets with an engagement rate above 5% and this graph should work only between 6PM IST to 11 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be above 50.

3. Create a line chart showing the trend of the average engagement rate over each month of the year. Separate the lines for tweets with media content and those without and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet engagement should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'C'.
